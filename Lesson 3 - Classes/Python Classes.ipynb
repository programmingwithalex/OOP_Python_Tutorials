    "### What are classes and why are they needed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons to use classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Organization: A class keeps all data attributes and functionality of an object in your program in one single location. If a change needs to be made to the object it only needs to be done in one place instead of every place the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Encapsulation: Functionality or data attributes of a class can be hidden from the user. This means the functionality or attributes can only be invoked within the class, and the user can not invoke them from outside the class. The user only needs to know it works, not how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Inheritance: Base-level functionality or attributes can be defined in a top-level class. Then multiple sub-classes can **inherit** from the top-level class and either extend or override functionality and/or attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Reuse: The same advatange functions provided of reusing the same code throughout the program, classes provided that same functionality. It only needs to be defined once and can be reused anywhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The example here will be the same car factory from before. This car factory is a new brand called BMY. It sells three different types of cars BMY-A, BMY-B, BMY-C. The car classes being built are not just for describing the car, it has everything the car will need to be operational by the driver. For each of the points above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Organization: There will be a car class for BMY, BMY-A, BMY-B, and BMY-C.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Encapsulation: Each car class has a speed attribute. However, the end user can not change the speed attribute directly. The only way the user can change the speed is by calling the `accelerate()` or `stop()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Inheritance: The majority of attributes and functionality will be defined in the BMY top-level class. The other three classes will inherit from the top-level BMY class and not have to redefine anything. The bottom-level classes will only have to define attributes or functionality specific to those models, i.e. opening and closing a sunroof.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Reuse: To actually execute the code, having all functionality and attributes packaged in a class will dramatically reduce code rewrite.\n",
